  <ol>
    <li>Why do I want to learn this skill?
      What does it mean to you? What are your motivations? Will you prove something to yourself or
      people around you? Will you get a raise because you’re better at your job or will you get a better job?
      <p><em>Software Programming/Development has been my unfullfilled Career Dream.
          It remained unfulfilled due to reasons not worth discussing at this stage of my life.
          As on date I have achieved multiple milestones in my life & frankly have no plans to change my Career.
          However the need to learn Software development, that too a Full stack one came as a Choice in my Entreprenuerial Journey.
          My Quest towards development of my own product was unachievable by solely depending on my Employees as
          I always feel the Key to my Merecedes with some one else though I own it. Moreover with this everchanging technology its
          imperative for the Founder to be hand on with his own product.</em></p>
    </li>
    <li>What will I achieve if I learn this skill?
      Which doors will this skill open for you? Will you be able to earn more, have more flexibility in your
      work hours, work remotely and travel more?
      <p><em>My greatest achievement will be the new Skill that I will come to terms with.
          It would be the door to implement all my thoughts and experience along with prevalent technoligies & thus
          along with a full fledged Software team, build a world class Software which would actually become a solution
          to real lfe problems out there in the Corporate Account Recievables.</em></p>
    </li>
    <li>How will this skill change my life and my career?
      Would you get a raise at your current job or more respect from your boss once you’ve learnt this skill?
      Or will you be at Facebook, Amazon or Google instead? How would your life change?
      <p><em>Mastering this skill, most importantly will break loads of Mindblocks I have been carrying for many long years.
          This skill will definetely give me an upper hand as an Entreprenuer and help me acheieve far more success than I am capable of today.</em></p>
    </li>
    <li>How will learning this skill impact the lives of my family, friends and coworkers?
      What will you be able to do for your family or friends once you’ve learnt this skill? How will it change
      the way they think of you? Will your coworkers respect you more?
      <p><em>Learning this skill is solely my decision and is irrespective of any other persons view on it.
          This skill will immensely ugrade my own self respect & ofcourse make me a master of my buisness in all senses.</em></p>
    </li>
    <li>How will I feel if I never accomplish this?
      Would you feel disappointed? Would you feel like you’ve missed out?
      <p><em>I first downloaded an Course on Full stack development on 4th Jul 2020 & since then procratination and indiscipline have been my companions.
          Now its a fresh start & I wont excuse myself for anything but becoming an Offiially certifies Full Stack Developer</em></p>
    </li>
    <li>What would my life look like if I manage to accomplish this?
      Visualise it. What would life look like from the moment you wake up to the time you go to sleep? Will
      you be living by the sea? Would you kiss your beautiful wife/husband when you wake up?
      <p><em>Life would be still amazing but Yes! cannot agree more that It would be more under my control & with much lesser dependence on strangers.</em></p>
    </li>
